How to manage data with desktop app NextGIS QGIS
====================================================================================================

You can upload, edit and perform other operations with geodata in your :ref:`Web GIS <ngcom_description>` not only in :ref:`admin console <ngw_admin_interface>` but also with desktop app `NextGIS QGIS <http://nextgis.ru/nextgis-qgis/>`_.

To make it super-easy we've created `NextGIS Connect <https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/nextgis_connect/>`_ plugin. After successfull installation you'll see :guilabel:`NextGIS Resources` panel on the right side of the screen.

Establishing Web GIS connection
-----------------------------------

First you need to establish a connection to your Web GIS:

* Open :guilabel:`Settings` dialog from NextGIS Connect control panel;
* Press :guilabel:`New` button;
* In the opened dialog window fill in fields :guilabel:`URL` (for example, http://examples.nextgis.com) and :guilabel:`Name` (this name will be used in a list of available connections). In order to be able to create and delete resources uncheck a checkbox :guilabel:`As guest` and fill in fields :guilabel:`User name` and :guilabel:`Password`;

.. note:: 
   :guilabel:`User name` and :guilabel:`Password` to access your Web GIS are sent by email after you requested to create it (might take time). Email that you provided at `my.nextgis.com <https://my.nextgis.com/>`_ is used. User name and password can also be assigned later by Web GIS administrator through its Control panel.

* Press :guilabel:`ะะบ` button. If the connection is established successfully you'll see your Web GIS resources tree in the plugin window.

Creating and uploading data
------------------------------------------------

NextGIS Connect plugin enables a fast upload of raster and vector data and whole QGIS projects to Web GIS. You'll be able to publish your maps and geodata online very quick and easy.

Uploading vector data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning:: 
   You can avoid :ref:`data format limitations <ngcom_vector_layer>` when uploading vector data to Web GIS through NextGIS Connect by switching on options "Rename forbidden fields" and "Fix incorrect geometries" in :guilabel:`Settings` dialog.

* Create in QGIS from scratch or upload from :term:`ESRI Shape`, :term:`GeoJSON` or :term:`CSV` files vector layers. Tailor their styles;
* Select in NextGIS Connect Resources panel :ref:`Resource group <ngcom_resources_group>` to which you want to upload your data;
* Select in QGIS Layers panel a vector layer which you want to upload to Web GIS;
* Press :guilabel:`Import selected layer` button on NextGIS Connect control panel or select :menuselection:`NextGIS Connect --> Import selected layer` in layer context menu;
* If data is uploaded successfully you'll see in the relevant Resource group a new :ref:`Vector layer <ngcom_data_upload>` with :ref:`QGIS style <ngcom_styles>` tailored by you.

Uploading raster data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Add raster layers to QGIS from :term:`GeoTIFF` files;
* Select in NextGIS Connect Resources panel Resource group to which you want to upload your data;
* Select in QGIS Layers panel a raster layer which you want to upload to Web GIS;
* Press :guilabel:`Import selected layer` button on NextGIS Connect control panel or select :menuselection:`NextGIS Connect --> Import selected layer` in layer context menu;
* If data is uploaded successfully you'll see in the relevant Resource group a new :ref:`Raster layer <ngcom_data_upload>` with default :ref:`Raster style <ngcom_styles>`.

Uploading basemaps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Add basemaps to QGIS via TMS;
* Select in NextGIS Connect Resources panel Resource group to which you want to add your basemap;
* Select in QGIS Layers panel a basemap which you want to upload to Web GIS;
* Press :guilabel:`Import selected layer` button on NextGIS Connect control panel or select :menuselection:`NextGIS Connect --> Import selected layer` in layer context menu;
* If a basemap is uploaded successfully you'll see it the relevant Resource group.

You need to be on Mini or Premium to work with basemaps.

Creating and uploading a whole QGIS project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Create a QGIS project with raster and vector layers. Tailor their styles, group them, set their hierarchy and visibility settings. Set the map extent;
* Select in NextGIS Connect Resources panel :ref:`Resource group <ngcom_resources_group>` to which you want to upload the project;
* Press :guilabel:`Import current project` button on NextGIS Connect control panel or select :menuselection:`NextGIS Connect --> Import current project` in any layer context menu;
* In the opened dialog window fill in the name of the new Resource group to which the project will be imported;
* If the project is uploaded successfully you'll see in a selected Resource group a newly created group with: 1) all Raster and Vector layers to which :guilabel:`Import selected layer` operation is applicable, and their Styles; 2) :ref:`Web map <ngcom_webmap_create>` with a set extent, to which all the imported layers are added with groups, hierarchy and visibility settings similar to QGIS.

.. note:: 
	The fastest way to go to the newly created Web map is by pressing :guilabel:`Open map in browser` button on NextGIS Connect control panel or select :guilabel:`Open map in browser` in map's context layer.

.. _ngcom_ngqgis_connect_wfs_service:

Creating WFS services
--------------------------------------------------------------

NextGIS Connect plugin enables a fast publication of Vector layers from your Web GIS using standard :term:`WFS` protocol. 

It's possible due to the quick creation of :ref:`WFS service <ngcom_wfs_service>` option in NextGIS Connect:

* Select in NextGIS Connect Resources panel Vector layer which you want to publish using WFS protocol;
* Select :guilabel:`Create WFS service` in layer context menu;
* In the opened dialog window set the number of layer's features to be published via WFS service by changing the value of the field :guilabel:`The number of objects returned by default`;
* If WFS service is created successfully you'll see it in the relevant Resource group. The Vector layer is already connected to it.

.. note:: 
	You can edit settings of WFS service (including its name, published layers and their settings) in Web GIS admin console.
