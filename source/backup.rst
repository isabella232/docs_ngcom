Backup policy
=============

Data backups are performed for all Web GIS (any plan). The frequency is dependent on total data volume and Web GIS use activity (from once to several times per month).

Restoring data from backups is available for `Premium <https://nextgis.com/pricing-base/>`_ users only. Other plans Web GIS are backup-ed to mitigate possible infrastructure risks not connected to user actions.

If you are on Premium and you need a restore - send us an request to support@nextgis.com.
